**VirtualBox Configuration**

In VirtualBox, you need to create several virtual machines (VMs).

Creating Virtual Machines

- Open VirtualBox and create a new virtual machine (VM) for each instance to configure (e.g., 1 VPN server and 2 VPN clients).
- Choose a compatible operating system (e.g., a Linux distribution like Ubuntu).

Network Configuration

- For the VPN server: configure the VM in Host-Only mode so that it is isolated from the external network but can communicate with the other VMs.
- For the VPN clients: configure them also in Host-Only or Bridged mode (if you want them to access the internet via the VPN server).

Network in VirtualBox

- Host-Only: Create a private network between the host and the VMs.
- Bridged: Allows VMs to connect directly to your local network (if you want VPN clients to access the internet via the server).
